Freshchat iOS SDK
=================

"Modern messaging software that your sales and customer engagement teams will love." [Freshchat](http://www.freshchat.com) by [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com).

## Installation
Freshchat iOS SDK can be integrated using cocoapods by specifying the following in your podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'Your project target' do
pod 'FreshchatSDK'
end
```

> Starting with version X.X.X, we deploy the framework using XCFrameworks bundle. If you cannot support this approach, you can instead integrate using the library directly by using the following in your **Podfile**:
>
> ```ruby
> pod 'FreshchatSDK/VendoredLibrary'
> ```
